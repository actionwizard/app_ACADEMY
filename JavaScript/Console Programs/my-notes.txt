#POINT 1
In this we used the command
code test.txt 
(what happened is that this txt file was automatically created and opened in VS code directly)
if the file already exists then this command opened the file 

#POINT 2
Any extra instructions that you give to a command that begins with a dash like "-" is called a flag.

#POINT 3
A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
(relative path me abhi jaha hai waha se aage ka path likhte)

An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
(absolute path me root directory se path likha jata hai)

#POINT 4
Renaming a file from the command line is moving the file from one name to another. 
You use the mv command which means "move". 
It takes two arguments: the file that you want to move, and where you want to move it.
